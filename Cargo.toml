[patch.'https://github.com/rafalh/rust-fatfs']
### Temporary patch for fatfs which allows us to set the logging level.
### Once the below PR lands, we can remove this.

[patch.crates-io]
### Patch `spin` to use the `pause` asm instruction in busy-wait loops,
### because the `core::hint::spin_loop()` only uses it if "sse2" is enabled.
spin = { git = "https://github.com/theseus-os/spin-rs" }
### use our own version of volatile which supports zerocopy
volatile = { git = "https://github.com/theseus-os/volatile" }
### use our own no_std-compatilbe getopts
getopts = { git = "https://github.com/theseus-os/getopts" }
### use our own no_std-compatible qp trie
qp-trie = { git = "https://github.com/theseus-os/qp-trie-rs" }
### use our own no_std-compatible downcast-rs
downcast-rs = { git = "https://github.com/theseus-os/downcast-rs" }
### use the latest version of smoltcp from github; the one on crates.io is out of date
smoltcp = { git = "https://github.com/m-labs/smoltcp" }

### These profiles fix the new rustc behavior of splitting one crate into many object files. 
### That messes up our module loading, which is bad!
