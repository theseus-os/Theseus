### use our own no_std-compatilbe getopts
getopts = { git = "https://github.com/kevinaboos/getopts" }
### use our own no_std-compatible qp trie
qp-trie = { git = "https://github.com/theseus-os/qp-trie-rs" }
### temporarily use our own uX crate
ux = { git = "https://github.com/kevinaboos/uX", branch = "usize_isize_conversions" }

### These profiles fix the new rustc behavior of splitting one crate into many object files. 
### That messes up our module loading, which is bad!
### See this link about profiles: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
