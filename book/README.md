# All about Theseus

In addition to the documentation auto-generated from inline source code comments, you will find a more systematic overview of Theseus itself and how to contribute to its development, in the form of a small book.

The book is written in Markdown and uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) to build the book into a human-friendly form, e.g., HTML.

To compile the book's source files, install `mdbook` and in the documentation folder, run:  
`mdbook build`

When it successfully finishes, you can read the book starting at the top-level file `book/index.html`.
