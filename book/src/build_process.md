# Theseus's Build Process

Theseus uses the [cargo virtual workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/fest.html#the-workspace-section) feature to group all of the crates together into a single meta project, which significantly speeds up build times.

The top-level Makefile basically just invokes the Rust toolchain and compiler, copies the built object files into a top-level build directory, and then generates a bootable .iso image using various bootloader tools.
We build all of the Rust code using [`xargo`](https://github.com/ric/xargo), a cross-compiler toolchain that wraps the default Rust `cargo`.
The only special action it takes is to build the `nano_core` separately and fully link it against the architecture-specific assembly code in `nano_core/boot` into a static binary.

## Debug vs. Release Mode

Theseus can be built in a variety of modes, but offers two presets: **debug** and **release** build modes.
By default, Theseus is built in release mode for usable performance within an emulator like QEMU.
To build in debug mode, set the `BUILD_MODE` environment variable when running `make`, like so:
`make run BUILD_MODE=debug`

There is a special file `cfg/Config.mk` that contains the build mode options as well as other configuration options used in the kernel Makefile.
As with most languages, release mode in Rust is *way* faster, but it does take longer to compile and can be difficult to attach a debugger.

## Runtime Loading and Linking of Crates

By default, Theseus is built into a single kernel binary just like a regular OS, in which all crates are linked into a single static library and then zipped up into a bootable .iso file.
However, our actual research into runtime composability dictates that all crates (except the `nano_core`) are loaded at runtime, and not linked into a single static kernel binary.
To enable this, use the `make loadable` command to enable the `loadable` feature, which does the following:

* Builds each crate into its own separate object file, which are not all linked together like in other OSes.
* Enables release mode in order to make each module file smaller and faster to load, i.e., sets LD_MODE=release`.
* Copies each crate's object file into the top-level build directory's module subdirectory (`build/grub-isofiles/modules`) such that each module is a separate object file in the final .iso image.
  That allows the running instance of Theseus to see all the modules currently available just by asking the loader (without needing a filesystem), and to load them individually.
* Sets the `loadable` config option, which as seen in the `nano_core`, will enable the `#![cfg(loadable)]` code blocks that dynamically load other crates rather than include them as static dependencies.
