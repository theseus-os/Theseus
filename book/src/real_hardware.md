# Booting Theseus on Real Hardware

We have tested Theseus on a variety of real machines, including Intel NUC devices, various Thinkpad laptops, and Supermicro servers. 
Currently, the only limiting factor is that the device support booting via USB or PXE using traditional BIOS rather than UEFI; support for UEFI is a work-in-progress. 

Note that as Theseus is not fully mature, booting on your own hardware is done at your own risk. Be sure that you have a backup of all of your important files before doing so. 

If you experience a problem booting Theseus on your own hardware, please [file a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/issues) to help the Theseus developers work towards supporting your hardware!
