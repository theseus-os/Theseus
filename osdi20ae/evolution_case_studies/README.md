# Live Evolution Evaluation

This README contains the instructions necessary to reproduce the three live evolution scenarios shown in Figure 2 of the submission. All three case studies are described below.
1. [Evolving the scheduler/runqueue from round robin to priority](#-Scheduler-evolution)
2. [Evolving the synchronous rendezvous channels into async channels](#-Inter-task-Communication-Channel-Evolution)
1. [Evolving multiple network layers to fix buggy behavior](#-Network-Usage-and-NIC-Driver-Joint-Evolution)


### Dependencies
The live evolution experiments are most easily reproduced by downloading updated crates from a "build server" which is simply a local webserver based on Python's SimpleHTTP program.
This scenario accurately represents an over-the-air live evolution scenario in which evolutionary updates are downloaded from a server.     
The webserver requires `python2.7` and `rhash`. 
* Run the following: `sudo apt-get install -y python2.7 rhash`

You will also need an environment for building and running Theseus, as described in the [main Theseus README](../../README.md#Building-Theseus). 


### Common Arguments and Useful Tips
* In the instructions below, the `host=yes` argument enables KVM; this is recommended, but technically optional (e.g., if your system doesn't support KVM).     
* The `THESEUS_CONFIG=loscd_eval` config argument enables printing of timing measurements for each stage of the evolutionary procedure.     
  We have chosen to include it in the below instructions by default.
* As mentioned in the [main Theseus README](../../README.md#Using-QEMU), you can press `Ctrl+Alt+G` to release focus of your keyboard and mouse from the QEMU window so that you can do other tasks like open shells on your host OS. 


### Calculating Measurements in Figure 2
The format of Figure 2 graphs each part of the evolutionary procedure on the y-axis with the time taken for that part on the x-axis. The time values  are calculated from Theseus's log printouts at the end of the evolutionary procedure. The printout looks something like this (the state transfer part does not always occur):    
<img src="./evolution_log.png" width="550" />

The below table describes how the Figure 2 values are calculated from the tables.     
All measurements are then converted from HPET ticks into time values using the `HPET PERIOD` value (in femtoseconds), as such:

```
<log printout value> * <HPET_PERIOD> / <femtosec per millisec>
```
(There are 10^12 femtoseconds per millisecond)

# Scheduler evolution
This case study evolves Theseus's existing round-robin scheduler (and runqueue) into priority-based ones.

Navigate to the base Theseus directory. 

Start with a clean slate:    
```
make clean
```

**[Host shell 1]**     
In one shell, build and run Theseus in loadable mode:     
```
make loadable THESEUS_CONFIG=loscd_eval net=user host=yes
```
(You can optionally press `Ctrl+Z` in Host shell 1 to pause QEMU while doing the next part, and then resume it later with `fg`.)

**[Host shell 2]**     
After Theseus finishes building and is running, open another shell on your host machine. In that new shell, build the priority scheduler update and start the build server using the following command: 
```
make build_server \
     THESEUS_CONFIG="loadable loscd_eval priority_scheduler" \
     UPDATE_DIR=prio STATE_TRANSFER=state_transfer::prio_sched
```

Let the build complete. The build server automatically determines the differences between the first version of Theseus you built in Host shell 1 and the second evolved version you built in Host shell 2, and creates an evolutionary update package in a folder named `$UPDATE_DIR`.    
You should see the build server running, e.g., something like:    
*Starting simple HTTP server at "/<path_to>/.theseus_build_server" with new update "prio"*.

Note: if you accidentally stopped the instance of Theseus in QEMU started in **Host shell 1** before or after the above build server step, don't worry. Just build and run it again using the same command. 

**[Theseus shell]**    
After the build server is ready, switch back to the running instance of Theseus in QEMU, and type the following commands in Theseus's shell to download the evolutionary update:
```
upd dl prio
```

You should observe the build server logging GET requests in the **Host shell 2**, and the Theseus console log (in Host shell 1) showing Theseus’s `upd` app downloading files. 

Once the evolutionary updates are downloaded within Theseus, apply them:
```
upd ap prio
```

After that, the priority scheduler is active and can be observed, e.g., run the `ps` command to see task priorities that did not previously exist. 

If the `loscd_eval` config option was provided, you will see several yellow printouts towards the end of the console log (in Host Shell 1) that list the “Measured time in units of HPET ticks” for various live evolution stages.


# Inter-task Communication Channel Evolution
This case study evolves Theseus's existing synchronous rendezvous channel used for inter-task communication (ITC, like IPC) into an asynchronous buffered channel. 
It can be reproduced very similarly to the above scheduler evolution case.

Navigate to the base Theseus directory. 

Start with a clean slate:    
```
make clean
```

**[Host shell 1]**     
In one shell, build and run Theseus in loadable mode. By default, this will build a version of Theseus that uses the synchronous `rendezvous` channel for ITC.  
```
make loadable THESEUS_CONFIG="loscd_eval trace_channel" net=user host=yes
```

**[Host shell 2]**     
After Theseus finishes building and is running, open another shell on your host machine. In that new shell, build the asynchronous channel update and start the build server using the following command:
```
make build_server \
     THESEUS_CONFIG="loadable loscd_eval trace_channel use_async_channel" \
     UPDATE_DIR=chan
```

Let the build complete and wait for the build server to start, as with the previous scheduler case study.

**[Theseus shell]**    
After the build server is ready, switch back to the running instance of Theseus in QEMU, and type the following commands.     
First, run a channel test application in Theseus's shell. 
```
channel_app
```

While this is running, (if built with the `loscd_eval` config) you can observe Theseus's ITC using a synchronous rendezvous channel implementation.  

Then, evolve Theseus to use asynchronous ITC channels instead. Download the evolutionary updates and then apply them:
```
upd dl chan
upd ap chan
```

If the `loscd_eval` config option was provided, you will see several yellow printouts towards the end of the console log (in Host Shell 1) that list the “Measured time in units of HPET ticks” for various live evolution stages.
If you run the `channel_app` again within Theseus, you will also see that Theseus is using asynchronous channels for ITC instead of the synchronous rendezvous channel it was previously using before the evolution.

The difference in behavior is illustrated below. 
Before evolution, Theseus had a synchronous rendezvous-based (bufferless) channel implementation, so messages are sent and received in lockstep, as shown in this image:    
<img src="./rendezvous_channel.png" width="610" />

After evolution, Theseus has an asychronous buffered channel implementation, so multiple successive messages can be sent before the first one is received, as shown in this image:     
<img src="./asynchronous_channel.png" width="600" />


# Network Usage and NIC Driver Joint Evolution
This case study starts with a previous version of Theseus, in which there were bugs in our e1000 NIC driver as well as our update client that downloads updated crates over HTTP. These bugs resulted in inconsistent network behavior that would sometimes fail to fully receive network packets, because the NIC's ringbuffer was used incorrectly (its rx/tx descriptor pointers set improperly).
We then evolve Theseus to a new version that includes fixes to both of those components, representing simultaneous evolution of multiple co-dependent entities (both above and below the network stack).

Navigate to the base Theseus directory. 

Start with a clean slate:    
```
make clean
```

**[Host shell 1]**     
In one shell, "revert back" to the buggy version of Theseus by running the patch script, and then build and run that buggy version of Theseus in loadable mode.
```
./osdi20ae/evolution_case_studies/buggy_network/patch_buggy_network.sh

make loadable THESEUS_CONFIG="loscd_eval" net=user host=yes
```

**[Host shell 2]**     
After Theseus finishes building and is running (please leave it running in the background), open another shell on your host machine. In that new shell, restore the working, non-buggy version of Theseus, then start the build server using the following command:
```
git reset --hard 

make build_server \
     THESEUS_CONFIG="loadable loscd_eval" \
     UPDATE_DIR=network
```

Let the build complete and wait for the build server to start, as with the previous case study.


**[Theseus shell]**    
After the build server is ready, switch back to the running instance of Theseus in QEMU, and type the following commands to evolve Theseus to the working version that fixes the networking bugs.      
**Note:** because the network itself is buggy and inconsistent, it may take a few tries to properly download the updated crates. These bugs do not always manifest, so it may work the first time.
```
upd dl network   # if this fails, try it again
upd ap network
```

The networking features in Theseus have now been live evolved to the correct version and work properly. 

If the `loscd_eval` config option was provided, you will see several yellow printouts towards the end of the console log (in Host Shell 1) that list the “Measured time in units of HPET ticks” for various live evolution stages.    


For added context, here's a screenshot of an example network failure due to the above network bugs from the old version. It fails to connect to a remote socket via TCP because Theseus failed to properly receive the packets used to establish the TCP connection.
