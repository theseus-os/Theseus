//! A rendezvous-based channel for synchronous Inter-Task Communication (ITC).
//! 
//! This crate offers a rendezvous channel, in which two tasks can exchange messages
//! without an intermediary buffer. 
//! The sender and receiver tasks must rendezvous together to exchange data,
//! so at least one of them must block. 
//! 
//! Only `Send` types can be sent or received through the channel.
//! 
//! This is not a zero-copy channel; 
//! To avoid copying large messages, use a reference (layer of indirection) like `Box`.
//! 
//! TODO: add support for a queue of pending senders and receivers 
//!       so that we can enable MPMC (multi-producer multi-consumer) behavior
//!       that allows senders and receivers to be cloned. 
//!       Note that currently only a single receiver and single sender is supported.
