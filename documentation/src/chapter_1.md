# Introduction

Theseus is a new runtime-composable OS that tackles the problem of *state spill*, the harmful yet ubiquitous phenomenon described in our [research paper from EuroSys 2017 here](http://kevinaboos.web.rice.edu/statespy.html).

We have designed and built Theseus from scratch using Rust to completely rethink state management in an OS, with the intention of avoiding state spill or mitigating its effects to the fullest extent possible. 

More details are provided in Theseus's [documentation](#Documentation).
