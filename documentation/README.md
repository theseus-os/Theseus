# All about Theseus

In addition to the documentation generated from embedded comments, you will find a more systematic overview of Theseus itself and how to contribute to its development, in the form of a small book.

The book is written with the Markdown markup language, using [mdBook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/).

To compile the source files, install `mdbook` and in the documentation folder, run:
`mdbook build`

When it successfully returns, you can start reading the book from `book/index.html`.
