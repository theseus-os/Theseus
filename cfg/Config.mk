## Tell rustc to output the native object file for each crate,
## which avoids always having to unpack the crate's .rlib archive to extract the object files within.
## Note that we still do have to extract and partially link object files from .rlib archives for crates that
## use a build script to generate additional object files during build time.

## This prevents monomorphized instances of generic functions from being shared across crates.
## It vastly simplifies the procedure of finding missing symbols in the crate loader,
## because we know that instances of generic functions will not be found in another crate
## besides the current crate or the crate that defines the function.
## As far as I can tell, this does not have a significant impact on object code size or performance.
## More info: <https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/explicit-monomorphization-for-compilation-time-reduction/15907/7>
##
## Update: this might work now, see <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96486#issuecomment-1180395751>.
## Thus, we should experiment with removing this to see if it offers any code size reduction benefits
## without breaking our loader/linker assumptions.

## This forces frame pointers to be generated, i.e., the stack base pointer (RBP register on x86_64)
## will be used to store the starting address of the current stack frame.
## This can be used for obtaining a backtrace/stack trace,
## but isn't necessary because Theseus supports parsing DWARF .debug_* sections to handle stack unwinding.
## Note that this reduces the number of registers available to the compiler (by reserving RBP),
## so it often results in slightly lowered performance. 
## By default, this is not enabled.
