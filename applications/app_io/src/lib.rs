//! This crate is an application-level library that stores the IO queues and pointers to terminal instances for running applications.
//! It provides some APIs similar to std::io for applications to access those queues.
//! 
//! Usage example:
//! 1. shell spawns a new app, and creates queues of `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`
//! 2. shell stores the reader of `stdin` and writer of `stdout` and `stderr` to `app_io`,
//!    along with the reader of key event queue and the pointer to the running terminal instance.
//! 3. app calls app_io::stdin to get the reader of `stdin`, and can perform reading just like
//!    using the standard library
//! 4. app calls app_io::stdout to get the writer of `stdin`, and can perform output just like
//!    using the standard library
//! 5. after app exits, shell would set EOF flags to its `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` queues.
//! 6. if all apps in a job exit, app shell removes all the structure stored in `app_io` and
//!    destructs all stdio queues
