//! Application which checks the functionality of the ixgbe driver by sending 1 packet on each enabled queue,
//! and then (optionally) endlessly polling the receive queues.
//! There are two ways to test the nic:
//! 
//! 1. Directly accessing the queues through the main ixgbe nic object. This is the default test.
//! In this case all transmit queues can be tested by sending a packet on each transmit queue, but receive functionality will be tested randomly.
//! If Receive Side Scaling is enabled then received packets will be randomly forwarded to different receive queues.
//! If it's disabled, then all packets will be received on queue 0.
//! 
//! 2. Creating multiple virtual NICs and sending and receiving packets with them.
//! In this case all transmit queues can be tested by sending a packet on each transmit queue, and all receive queues can be tested.
//! Each receive queue is associated with a unique IP address, and packets with that destination IP address will be forwarded to that queue.
//! 
//! For the receiving functionality, you will have to set up a program on another machine that sends packets to the IP addresses assigned
//! to the virtual NICs. Since these are static IP addresses and won't be resolved through ARP, I manually add the (mac address, ip address)
//! pair to the ARP table of the sending machine:  "sudo arp -i interface_name -s ip_address mac_address" 
//! e.g."sudo arp -i eno1 -s 192.168.0.20 0c:c4:7a:d2:ee:1a"
