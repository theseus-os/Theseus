//! This crate contains a simple routine to start the first application (or set of applications). 
//! 
//! This should be invoked at or towards the end of the kernel initialization procedure. 
//!
//! ## Important Dependency Note
//!  
//! In general, Theseus kernel crates *cannot* depend on application crates.
//! However, this crate is a special exception in that it directly loads and runs
//! the first application crate.
//! 
//! Thus, it's safest to ensure that first application crate is always included
//! in the build by specifying it as a direct dependency here.
//! 
//! Currently, that crate is `applications/shell`, but if it changes,
//! we should change that dependendency in this crates `Cargo.toml` manifest.
