## In general, Theseus kernel crates *cannot* depend on application crates.
## However, this crate is a special exception in that it directly loads and runs
## the first application crate.
## Thus, it's safest to ensure that crate is always included in the build
## by specifying it as a direct dependency here.
##
## Note that this does NOT result in a direct runtime dependency
## from this kernel crate to the first application crate,
## but rather only a *build*-time dependency.
##
## Note: if another application crate is used, make sure to change
##       both this dependency and the invocation string in `lib.rs`.
