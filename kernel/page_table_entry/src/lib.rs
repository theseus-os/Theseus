//! Defines the structure of Page Table Entries (PTEs) on x86_64.
//!
//! This crate is also useful for frame deallocation, because it can determine
//! when a frame is mapped exclusively to only one page table entry, 
//! and therefore when it is safe to deallocate. 
//! 
//! Because Theseus ensures a bijective (1-to-1) mapping
//! between virtual pages and physical frames,
//! it is almost always the case that the frame pointed to 
//! by a newly-unmapped page table entry can be deallocated.
