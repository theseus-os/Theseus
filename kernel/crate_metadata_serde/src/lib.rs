//! Standalone crate containing (de)serializable types for crate and section metadata.
//! 
//! The primary reason this exists is because `LoadedCrate` and `LoadedSection`
//! make copious usage of `Arc` and `Weak` reference-counted pointer types,
//! which cannot be properly (de)serialized by `serde`. 
//! The types in this module remove those refcount types so that they can be
//! reconstructed individually at runtime after deserialization by the `crate_metadata` crate.
//!
//! This is currently only used to parse and serialize the `nano_core` binary at compile time.
//! The `nano_core`'s [`SerializedCrate`] is then included as a boot module
//! so it can be deserialized into a LoadedCrate at runtime by `mod_mgmt`.
//! 
//! Some other types have been moved from `crate_metadata` into this crate because
//! they are required for (de)serialization, e.g., [`SectionType`].
//! 
//! ## Goal: minimal dependencies
//! This crate's dependencies should be kept to a bare minimum in order to 
//! minimize the dependencies of the `tools/serialize_nano_core` executable,
//! allowing it to build and run quickly.
//! 
//! Thus, instead of using Theseus-specific types here in this crate,
//! we prefer using types from this crate in other Theseus kernel crates.
//! For example, instead of implementing the routines to convert a `SerializedCrate`
//! into a `LoadedCrate` here, we implement the routine to create a `LoadedCrate`
//! from a `SerializedCrate` in the `mod_mgmt` crate itself.
//! In other words, other larger/complex Theseus crates should depend on this crate
//! instead of this crate depending on other Theseus crates.
