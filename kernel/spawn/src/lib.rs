//! This crate offers routines for spawning new tasks
//! and convenient builder patterns for customizing new tasks. 
//! 
//! The two functions of interest to create a `TaskBuilder` are:
//! * [`new_task_builder()`][tb]:  creates a new task for a known, existing function.
//! * [`new_application_task_builder()`][atb]: loads a new application crate and creates a new task
//!    for that crate's entry point (main) function.

///
/// During the final part of the context switch operation, the `ret` instruction will
/// implicitly pop an address value off of the stack (the last item of that Context struct);
