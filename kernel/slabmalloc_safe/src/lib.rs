// A slab allocator adapted from the slabmalloc crate.
// The original can be found at https://crates.io/crates/slabmalloc


//! A slab allocator implementation for objects less than 8KiB.
//! This allocator uses only safe Rust and associates an `AllocablePages`'s lifetime with its `MappedPages` object.
//! The only way to achieve this is to store the MappedPages in statically sized buffers (Page Lists),
//! so the heap size is set at compile time and cannot grow. 
//! Additional pages cannot be added when an OOM error occurs.
//! 
//! # Overview
//!
//! The organization is as follows:
//!
//!  * A `ZoneAllocator` manages many `SCAllocator` and can
//!    satisfy requests for different allocation sizes.
//!  * A `SCAllocator` allocates objects of exactly one size.
//!    It stores the objects and meta-data in one or multiple `AllocablePage` objects.
//!  * A trait `AllocablePage` that defines the page-type from which we allocate objects.
//!
//! Lastly, it provides a default `AllocablePage` implementations `ObjectPage8k` that is 8 KiB in size 
//! and contains allocated objects and associated meta-data
