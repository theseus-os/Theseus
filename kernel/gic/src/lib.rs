//! The term "Forwarding" is sometimes used in this crate.
//! This is because the Distributor, Redistributor and CPU interface are
//! chained in the controller. The distributor and the redistributor are
//! configured by the code of this crate to either allow (forward)
//! interrupts or disallow (discard) them.
