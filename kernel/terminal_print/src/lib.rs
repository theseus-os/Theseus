//! Applications that want to print to their parent terminal must import this crate
//! To print, applications can call the println! or print! macros
//! 
//! Printing simulates the parent-child relationship for standard out when parent applications spawn child applications
//! For example, when a terminal runs a command, it will map that child command's task ID to that terminal's print producer
//! so that any output from the child command is identified and outputted to the parent terminal
//! 
//! # Deprecated
//! This crate is deprecated in favor of using proper stdio streams. 
//! 
//! # Note
//! This printing crate only supports single-task applications. 
//! If an application itself spawns child tasks, those will not be able to properly print through these interfaces.
