//! Trait definitions for storage devices and storage controllers. 
//! 
//! All storage devices should implement the `StorageDevice` trait, 
//! such as hard disk drives, optical discs, SSDs, etc. 
//! All storage controllers should implement the `StorageController` trait,
//! such as AHCI controllers and IDE controllers.
//! 
//! Below is a quick example of how to iterate through available `StorageDevice`s on the system
//! and usage of the `StorageDevice` trait methods, as well as how to downcast it
//! into a specific concrete type, such as an `AtaDrive`.
//! ```rust
//! if let Some(controller) = storage_manager::storage_controllers().next() {
//!     if let Some(sd) = controller.lock().devices().next() {
//!         {
//!             // Call `StorageDevice` trait methods directly
//!             let mut locked_sd = sd.lock();
//!             debug!("Found drive with size {}, {} sectors", locked_sd.size_in_bytes(), locked_sd.size_in_blocks());
//! 
//!             // Here we downcast the `StorageDevice` into an `AtaDrive` so we can call `AtaDrive` methods.
//!             if let Some(ata_drive) = locked_sd.as_any_mut().downcast_mut() {
//!                 debug!("      drive was master? {}", ata_drive.is_master());
//! 
//!                 // Read 10 sectors from the beginning of the drive (at offset 0)
//!                 let mut initial_buf: [u8; 5120] = [0; 5120]; // 10 sectors of bytes
//!                 let sectors_read = ata_drive.read_pio(&mut initial_buf[..], 0).unwrap();
//!                 debug!("[SUCCESS] sectors_read: {:?}", sectors_read);
//!                 debug!("{:?}", core::str::from_utf8(&initial_buf));
//! 
//!                 // Write 3 sectors to the drive
//!                 let mut write_buf = [0u8; 512*3];
//!                 for b in write_buf.chunks_exact_mut(16) {
//!                     b.copy_from_slice(b"QWERTYUIOPASDFJK");
//!                 }
//!                 let bytes_written = ata_drive.write_pio(&write_buf[..], 2).unwrap();
//!                 debug!("WRITE_PIO {:?}", bytes_written);
//!             }
//!         }
//!         // Read 10 sectors from the drive using the `StorageDevice` trait methods.
//!         let mut after_buf: [u8; 5120] = [0; 5120];
//!         let sectors_read = sd.lock().read_blocks(&mut after_buf[..], 0).unwrap();
//!         debug!("{:X?}", &after_buf[..]);
//!         debug!("{:?}", core::str::from_utf8(&after_buf));
//!         trace!("POST-WRITE READ_BLOCKS {} sectors", sectors_read);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! # Limitations
//! 
//! Note that if other crates are using a storage device through a block cache, 
//! the cache does not own the storage device and cache validity is questionable.
//! Be careful in that case. See the warning in the [block_cache](../block_cache/index.html) module.
