//! Support for the Performance Monitoring Unit 
//! 
//! We have support for PMU version 2. Each succesive PMU version includes the features provided by the previous versions.
//! 
//! Version 1 Support:
//! To configure an architectural performance monitoring event, we program the performance event select registers (IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs).
//! The result of the performance monitoring event is reported in a general purpose Performance Monitoring Counter (PMC) (IA32_PMCx MSR).
//! There is one PMC for each performance event select register, and one PMU per logical core. 
//! 
//! Version 2 Support:
//! Three of the architectural events are counted using fixed function MSRs (IA32_FIXED_CTR0 through IA32_FIXED_CTR2), 
//! each with an associated control register.
//! Three more MSRS are provided to simplify event programming. They are: 
//! * IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL: 
//!     allows software to enable/disable event counting of any combination of fixed-function PMCs or any general-purpose PMCs via a single WRMSR.
//! * IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS: 
//!     allows software to query counter overflow conditions on any combination of fixed-function PMCs or general-purpose PMCs via a single RDMSR.
//! * IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTRL: 
//!     allows software to clear counter overflow conditions on any combination of fixed-function PMCs or general-purpose PMCs via a single WRMSR.
//! 
//! We support 2 ways to use the PMU. One is to measure the number of events that take place over a length of code.
//! The second is Event Based Sampling, where after a specified number of events occur, an interrupt is called and we store the instruction pointer 
//! and task id running at that point.
//! 
//! Currently we support a maximum core ID of 255, and up to 8 general purpose counters per core. 
//! A core ID greater than 255 is not supported in Theseus in general since the ID has to fit within a u8.
//! 
//! If the core ID limit is changed and we need to update the PMU data structures to support more cores then: 
//! - Increase WORDS_IN_BITMAP and CORES_SUPPORTED_BY_PMU as required. For example, the cores supported is 256 so there are 4 64-bit words in the bitmap, one bit per core. 
//! - Add additional AtomicU64 variables to the initialization of the CORES_SAMPLING and RESULTS_READY bitmaps. 
//! 
//! If the general purpose PMC limit is reached then: 
//! - Update PMCS_SUPPORTED_BY_PMU to the new PMC limit.
//! - Change the element type in the PMCS_AVAILABLE vector to be larger than AtomicU8 so that there is one bit per counter.
//! - Update INIT_PMCS_AVAILABLE to the new maximum value for the per core bitmap.
//! 
//! Monitoring without interrupts is almost free (around 0.3% performance penalty) - source: "These are Not Your Grand Daddy's CPU Performance Counters" Blackhat USA, 2015
//! 
//! # Example
//! ```
//! pmu_x86::init();
//! 
//! let counter_freq = 0xFFFFF;
//! let num_samples = 500;
//! let sampler = pmu_x86::start_samples(pmu_x86::EventType::UnhaltedReferenceCycles, counter_freq, None, num_samples);
//! 
//! if let Ok(my_sampler) = sampler {
//! 
//! 	// wait some time here
//! 	
//! 	if let Ok(mut samples) = pmu_x86::retrieve_samples() {
//! 		pmu_x86::print_samples(&mut samples);
//! 	}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Note
//! Currently, the PMU-based sampler will only capture samples on the same core as it was initialized and started from. 
//! So, if you run `pmu_x86::init()` and `pmu_x86::start_samples()` on CPU core 2, it will only sample events on core 2.
