//! Offers the `pause` instruction, which rustc used to use for 
//! `spin_loop_hint()` and `spin_loop()` before March 15th, 2019. 
//! 
//! For some reason, their current implementation of those functions
//! emits the `_mm_pause()` intrinsic *only when* "sse2" is enabled,
//! instead of always emitting it regardless of configuration.
//! The lack of `pause` harms Theseus's performance within the QEMU emulator.
//! No effect is noticeable on KVM or on real hardware.
