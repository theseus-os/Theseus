//! An asynchronous executor.
//!
//! This crate is very experimental. We currently spawn an OS thread (task) per
//! future, and use run states to wake the executor. Calling it an executor is
//! generous. It's merely a wrapper around a future that communicates between
//! the waker and the task system.
//!
//! The executor polls the future, passing in a waker which will unblock the
//! current task when awoken. If the future returns pending, the executor will
//! block the current task. When the future uses the waker, it unblocks the
//! task, and the executor loops around, polling the future again. It will
//! continue doing so until the future returns ready.
//!
//! The crate is named after the [Executor-class Start
//! Dreadnought][dreadnought] (`super_star_destroyer` was a bit too on the
//! nose).
//!
