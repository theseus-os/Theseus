//! Provides a `thread_local!()` macro, a helper to instantiate lazily-initialized 
//! thread-local storage (TLS) variables.
//! 
//! The primary difference between using this crate's `thread_local!()` macro
//! and directly using the `#[thread_local]` attribute is that `static` items
//! tagged with the `#[thread_local]` attribute will *never* be dropped,
//! just like all other `static`s.
//! 
//! However, static items defined in a `thread_local!()` macro block will be
//! destructed (e.g., dropped, destroyed) when that task exits.
//! 
//! # Rust std-based implementation notes
//! The code in this crate is adapted from [this version of the `thread_local!()` macro]
//! from the Rust standard library.
//! The main design has been left unchanged, but we have removed most of the configuration blocks
//! for complex platform-specific or OS-specific behavior.
//! Because Theseus supports the `#[thread_local]` attribute, we can directly use the 
//! TLS "fast path", which the Rust standard library refers to as the "FastLocalInnerKey".
//! 
//! ## Unsafety
//! We could probably could remove most of the unsafe code from this implementation,
//! because we don't have to account for the various raw platform-specific interfaces 
//! or using raw libc types like the original Rust std implementation does.
//! However, I have chosen to leave the code as close as possible to the original 
//! Rust std implementation in order to make updates as easy as possible,
//! for if and when the Rust std version changes and we wish to track/merge in those changes.
//!
