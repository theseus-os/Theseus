## In general, Theseus kernel crates *cannot* depend on application crates.
## However, this crate loads and runs the `hull` shell application,
## so it's best to ensure that the `hull` crate is always included in the build
## by specifying it as a direct dependency here.
##
## Note that this does NOT result in a direct runtime dependency
## from this crate to the `hull` crate; it merely guarantees it gets built.
