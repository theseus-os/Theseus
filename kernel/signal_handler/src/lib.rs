//! Signal handlers for CPU exceptions/errors, like POSIX-style signals, but safer and Rusty.
//! 
//! Instead of directly supporting POSIX signals like SIGSEGV, SIGILL, etc,
//! this crate only supports a few categories of signals that represent a CPU/machine exception,
//! e.g., divide errors, page faults, illegal instructions, etc.
//! 
//! Each task can [register] up to one signal handler per signal kind.
//! If/when that exception occurs, the full [context] of that exception is provided as an argument
//! to the registered signal handler.
//! 
//! Signal handlers can only be invoked once. If an exception occurs, it is up to the task logic
//! to re-register that signal handler again. 
//! 
//! [register]: register_signal_handler
//! [context]: SignalContext
