// ************ IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE ***********************
// All modification of task runstates must be performed atomically 
// with respect to adding or removing those tasks to/from the waitqueue itself.
// Otherwise, there could be interleavings that result in tasks not being notified properly,
// or not actually being put to sleep when being placed on the waitqueue, 
// or the task being switched away from after setting itself to blocked (when waiting) 
// but before it can release its lock on the waitqueue.
//    (Because once a task is blocked, it can never run again and thus 
//     has no chance to release its waitqueue lock, causing deadlock).
// Thus, we disable preemption (well, currently we disable interrupts) 
// AND hold the waitqueue lock while changing task runstate, 
// which ensures that once the task is blocked it will always release its waitqueue lock.
