//! A standalone, generic implementation of a Waker + Blocker pair -- a basic wait event.
//!
//! By standalone, we mean that this crate does not depend on tasking infrastructure
//! (e.g., the `task` crate) directly, meaning it is usable in the `task` crate.
//! This works by accepts generic actions (closures) for waking the [Waker](core::task::Waker)
//! and blocking the [Blocker].
