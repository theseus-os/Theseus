//! Abstractions for deferred interrupt tasks, a companion to regular interrupt handlers.
//!
//! Deferred interrupt tasks are similar to the concept of "top half" and "bottom half"
//! interrupt handlers in other OSes, in which the top half is the short, latency-sensitive
//! function that runs immediately when the interrupt request is serviced,
//! while the bottom half is the more complex function that runs in a deferred manner
//! to handle longer operations.
//! Other terminology is often used, including "first-level" and
//! "second-level" interrupt handlers, or "hard" and "soft" interrupt handlers.
//!
//! That being said, this implementation of deferred interrupt tasks
//! differs from both tasklets and workqueues in Linux.
//! We also do not use the "top half" or "bottom half" terminology
//! because it is confusing and difficult to remember which is which.
//! Instead, we refer to the first latency-sensitive part as the
//! *interrupt handler* and the second later part as the *deferred task*.
//! The "interrupt handler" runs immediately (in a synchronous fashion) 
//! when the interrupt occurs, while the deferred task runs asynchronously
//! at some time in the future, ideally as soon as possible.
//! 
//! The general idea is that an interrupt handler should be short
//! and do the minimum amount of work possible in order to keep 
//! the system responsive, because all (or most) other interrupts
//! are typically disabled while the interrupt handler executes to completion.
//! Thus, most of the work should be deferred until later, such that the
//! interrupt handler itself only does a couple of quick things:
//!  * Notifies the deferred task that work is ready to be done,
//!    optionally providing details about what work it needs to do,
//!  * Acknowledges the interrupt such that the hardware knows it was handled.  
//!
//! The deferred task is tied directly to a single interrupt handler in a 1-to-1 manner
//! at the time of creation, which occurs in [`register_interrupt_handler()`].
//! Therefore, it is both efficient and easy to use. 
//! In the simplest of cases, such as a serial port device, the interrupt handler
//! only needs to mark the deferred task as unblocked (runnable)
//! and then acknowledge the interrupt. 
//! No other data exchange is needed between the interrupt handler and the 
//! deferred task.
//! For more complicated cases, the interrupt handler may need to do a minimal
//! amount of bookkeeping tasks (such as advancing a ringbuffer index)
//! and potentially send some information about what the deferred task should do.
//! It is typically best to use a lock-free queue or an interrupt-safe mutex
//! to share such information between the interrupt handler and deferred task.
//!

/// * `interrupt_handler`: the handler to be registered,
///    which will be invoked when the interrupt occurs.
/// * `deferred_interrupt_action`: the closure/function callback that will be invoked
///    in an asynchronous manner after the `interrupt_handler` runs. See the below section.
/// * `deferred_action_argument`: the argument that will be passed to the above
///    `deferred_interrupt_action` function.
/// * `deferred_task_name`: the optional name that will be given to the newly-spawned deferred task.
/// 
/// # How deferred interrupt tasks work
/// This deferred interrupt task spawned and returned by this function
/// is essentially an infinite loop that repeatedly invokes the `deferred_interrupt_action`.
/// The task will put itself to sleep (block itself) in between each invocation,
/// so it is the job of the given `interrupt_handler` to notify/wake up this task 
/// when there is work to be done. 
/// This design avoids the need for the `deferred_interrupt_action` to manually handle
/// repeated calls in and amongst the sleep/wake behavior.
///
/// It is the caller's responsibility to notify or otherwise wake up the deferred interrupt task
/// in the given `interrupt_handler` (or elsewhere, arbitrarily). 
/// WIthout doing this, the `deferred_interrupt_action` will never be invoked.
/// The returned [`JoinableTaskRef`] is useful for doing this, as you can `unblock` it when it needs to run,
/// e.g., when an interrupt has occurred.
///
/// # Return
/// * `Ok(JoinableTaskRef)` if successfully registered, in which the returned task is the
///    long-running loop that repeatedly invokes the given `deferred_interrupt_action`.
/// * `Err(existing_handler_address)` if the given `interrupt_number` was already in use.
