//! An implementation of an allocator that uses multiple heaps. The heap that will be used on each allocation is determined by a key.
//! Right now we use the apic id as the key, so that we have per-core heaps.
//! 
//! The heaps are ZoneAllocators (given in the slabmalloc crate). Each ZoneAllocator maintains 11 separate "slab allocators" for sizes
//! 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and (8KiB - bytes of metadata) bytes. The maximum allocation size is given by `ZoneAllocator::MAX_ALLOC_SIZE`.
//! The slab allocator maintains linked lists of allocable pages from which it allocates objects of the same size. 
//! The allocable pages are 8 KiB (`ObjectPage8k::SIZE`), and have metadata stored in the ending bytes (`ObjectPage8k::METADATA_SIZE`).
//! The metadata includes a heap id, MappedPages object this allocable page belongs to, forward and back pointers to pages stored in a linked list and a
//! bitmap to keep track of allocations. The maximum allocation size can change if the size of the objects in the metadata change. If that happens it will be automatically
//! reflected in the constants `ZoneAllocator::MAX_ALLOC_SIZE` and `ObjectPage8k::METADATA_SIZE`
//! 
//! Any memory request greater than maximum allocation size, a large allocation, is satisfied through a request for pages from the kernel.
//! All other requests are satisfied through the per-core heaps.
//! 
//! The per-core heap which will be used on allocation is determined by the cpu that the task is running on.
//! On deallocation of a block, the heap id is retrieved from metadata at the end of the allocable page which contains the block.
//! 
//! When a per-core heap runs out of memory, pages are first moved between the slab allocators of the per-core heap, then requested from other per-core heaps.
//! If no empty pages are available within any of the per-core heaps, then more virtual pages are allocated from the range of virtual addresses dedicated to the heap
//! [KERNEL_HEAP_START](../kernel_config/memory/constant.KERNEL_HEAP_START.html) and dynamically mapped to physical memory frames.
