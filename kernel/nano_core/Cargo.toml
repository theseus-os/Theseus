[lib]
# This builds the nano_core as two types of libraries:
# 1) staticlib: required to build a self-contained, fully-linked .a file that we can boot into.
# 2) rlib: to build a partial object file that other crates can include and use without including the full nano_core code in their object file.
# we choose rlib instead of dylib, because according to https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html, a dynamic library cannot be converted into static,
# meaning that all "upstream dependencies are required to be in rlib format", so this must be rlib to other crates can be built against it
# Furthermore we cannot build it as a dylib instead of rlib because he custom x86_64-theseus target triple doesn't support it (really, Xargo doesn't support it)
