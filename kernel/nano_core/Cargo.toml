[lib]
# this builds both libtheseus.a and libtheseus.rlib
# staticlib is required to build a self-contained .a file that we can boot into
# rlib is for my hopeful attempt to satisfy the alloc crate and other dependencies when building other crates as dylibs

# we choose rlib, because according to https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html, a dynamic library cannot be converted into static,
# meaning that all "upstream dependencies are required to be in rlib format", so this must be rlib to other crates can be built against it
# Furthermore we cannot build it as a dylib instead of rlib because he custom x86_64-theseus target triple doesn't support it (really, Xargo doesn't support it)
