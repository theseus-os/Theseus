//! Key types and functions for multitasking that build on the basic [`Task`].
//!
//! The main types of interest are:
//! 1. [`TaskRef`]: a shareable reference to a `Task` that can actually be used,
//!    unlike the basic `Task` type that cannot be spawned, modified, or scheduled in.
//! 2. [`JoinableTaskRef`]: a derivative of `TaskRef` that allows the owner
//!    (a different task) to *join* that task, i.e., wait for it to exit,
//!    and to retrieve its [`ExitValue`].
//!
//! The main standalone functions allow one to:
//! 1. Obtain the current task:
//!    * [`with_current_task()`] is the preferred way, which accepts a closure
//!      that is invoked with access to the current task. This is preferred because
//!      it doesn't need to clone the current task reference and is thus most efficient.
//!    * [`get_my_current_task()`] returns a cloned reference to the current task
//!      and is thus slightly more expensive [`with_current_task()`].
//!    * [`get_my_current_task_id()`] is fastest if you just want the ID of the current task.
//!      Note that it is fairly expensive to obtain a task reference from a task ID.
//! 2. Register a kill handler for the current task -- [`set_kill_handler()`].
//! 3. Yield the current CPU and schedule in another task -- [`schedule()`].
//! 4. Switch from the current task to another specific "next" task -- [`task_switch()`].
//!
//! To create new task, use the task builder functions in [`spawn`](../spawn/index.html)
//! rather than attempting to manually instantiate a `TaskRef`.

    // *** Important Notes about Behavior after a Context Switch ***
    //
    // Here, after the actual context switch operation, the stacks have been switched.
    // Thus, `next` has become the current task.
    //
    // If this is **NOT** the first time the newly-current task has run,
    // then it will resume execution below as normal because this is where it left off
    // when the context switch operation occurred.
    //
    // However, if this **is** the first time that the newly-current task
    // has been switched to and is running, the control flow will **NOT** proceed here.
    // Instead, it will have directly jumped to its entry point, i.e.,`spawn::task_wrapper()`.
    //
    // As such, anything we do below must also be done in `spawn::task_wrapper()`.
    // Thus, we want to ensure that post-context switch actions below are kept minimal
    // and are easy to replicate in `task_wrapper()`.
