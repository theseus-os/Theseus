//! This crate contains the `Task` structure for supporting multithreading, 
//! and the associated code for dealing with tasks.
//! 
//! To create new `Task`s, use the [`spawn`](../spawn/index.html) crate.
//! 
//! # Examples
//! How to wait for a `Task` to complete (using `join()`) and get its exit value.
//! ```
//! taskref.join(); // taskref is the task that we're waiting on
//! if let Some(exit_result) = taskref.take_exit_value() {
//!     match exit_result {
//!         ExitValue::Completed(exit_value) => {
//!             // here: the task ran to completion successfully, so it has an exit value.
//!             // We should know the return type of this task, e.g., if `isize`,
//!             // we would need to downcast it from Any to isize.
//!             let val: Option<&isize> = exit_value.downcast_ref::<isize>();
//!             warn!("task returned exit value: {:?}", val);
//!         }
//!         ExitValue::Killed(kill_reason) => {
//!             // here: the task exited prematurely, e.g., it was killed for some reason.
//!             warn!("task was killed, reason: {:?}", kill_reason);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
