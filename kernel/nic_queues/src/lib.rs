//! Defines the receive and transmit queues that store a ring of DMA descriptors and related information.
//! 
//! Receive and transmit queues are used across all NICs to keep track of incoming and outgoing packets.
//! HW queues used by the NIC only consist of the ring of DMA descriptors.
//! The SW queues defined here hold the ring of DMA descriptors that it shares with the HW,
//! as well as other information such as the buffers received from the queues,
//! the tail register for each queue and the cpu the queue is mapped to.
