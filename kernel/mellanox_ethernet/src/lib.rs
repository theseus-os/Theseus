//! This crate defines the layout of memory objects that make up the software interface between the Mellanox hardware and the driver,
//! as well as functions to access different fields of these objects.
//!
//! The Mellanox ethernet card is referred to as both the NIC (Network Interface Card) and the HCA (Host Channel Adapter).
//!
//! All information is taken from the Mellanox Adapters Programmerâ€™s Reference Manual (PRM) [Rev 0.54], unless otherwise specified.
