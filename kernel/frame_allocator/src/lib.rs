//! Provides an allocator for physical memory frames.
//! The minimum unit of allocation is a single frame. 
//!
//! This is currently a copy of the `page_allocator` crate.
//! TODO: extract the common code and create a generic allocator that can be specialized to allocate pages or frames.
//! 
//! This also supports early allocation of frames (up to 32 individual chunks)
//! before heap allocation is available, and does so behind the scenes using the same single interface. 
//! 
//! Once heap allocation is available, it uses a dynamically-allocated list of frame chunks to track allocations.
//! 
//! The core allocation function is [`allocate_frames_deferred()`](fn.allocate_frames_deferred.html), 
//! but there are several convenience functions that offer simpler interfaces for general usage. 
//!
//! # Notes and Missing Features
//! This allocator currently does **not** merge freed chunks (de-fragmentation). 
//! We don't need to do so until we actually run out of address space or until 
//! a requested address is in a chunk that needs to be merged;
//! that's where we should add those merging features in whenever we do so.
