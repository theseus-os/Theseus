//! An asynchronous channel for Inter-Task Communication (ITC) with an internal queue for buffering messages.
//! 
//! This crate offers an asynchronous channel that allows multiple tasks
//! to exchange messages through the use of a bounded-capacity intermediate buffer.
//! Unlike the `rendezvous` channel, the sender and receiver do not need to rendezvous to send or receive data.
//! 
//! Only `Send` types can be sent or received through the channel.
//! 
//! This is not a zero-copy channel; 
//! to avoid copying large messages, use a reference (layer of indirection) like `Box`.
