//! Provides an allocator for virtual memory pages.
//! The minimum unit of allocation is a single page. 
//! 
//! This also supports early allocation of pages (up to 32 individual chunks)
//! before heap allocation is available, and does so behind the scenes using the same single interface. 
//! 
//! Once heap allocation is available, it uses a dynamically-allocated list of page chunks to track allocations.
//! 
//! The core allocation function is [`allocate_pages_deferred()`](fn.allocate_pages_deferred.html), 
//! but there are several convenience functions that offer simpler interfaces for general usage.
