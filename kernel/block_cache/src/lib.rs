//! A caching layer for block based storage devices.
//! 
//! For many storage devices, calls to the backing medium are quite expensive. This layer intends to reduce those calls,
//! improving efficiency in exchange for additional memory usage. Note that this crate is intended to be used as a part of
//! `block_io`, but should work on its own.
//! 
//! # Limitations
//! Currently, the `BlockCache` struct is hardcoded to use a `StorageDevice` reference,
//! when in reality it should just use anything that implements traits like `BlockReader + BlockWriter`. 
//! 
//! The read and write functions currently only support reading/writing individual blocks from disk even
//! when the caller might prefer reading a larger number of contiguous blocks. This is inneficient and an
//! optimized implementation should read multiple blocks at once if possible.
//! 
//! Cached blocks are stored as vectors of bytes on the heap, 
//! we should do something else such as separate mapped regions. 
//! Cached blocks cannot yet be dropped to relieve memory pressure. 
//! 
//! Note that this cache only holds a reference to the underlying block device.
//! As such if any other system crates perform writes to the underlying device,
//! in that case the cache will give incorrect and potentially inconsistent results.
//! In the long run, the only way around this would be to only expose a `BlockCache`
//! instead of exposing a `StorageDevice`. I suppose the least disruptive way to implement this
//! might be with a layer of indirection to an implementor of a BlockReader like trait,
//! so that the underlying block reader can be switched out when a cache is enabled.
