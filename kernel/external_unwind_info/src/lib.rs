//! Registers and stores unwind information from external components.
//! 
//! Typically, Theseus maintains metadata about all crates loaded and linked into system.
//! Unwind info is part of this (the `.eh_frame` section data).
//! 
//! However, for other components compiled outside of Theseus and beyond it's knowledge,
//! we don't necessarily have control over or access to those components' section structure
//! and miscellaneous internal information.
//! Nevertheless, we still want to be able to handle their resource management properly
//! by unwinding through their stack frames and running cleanup handlers as needed.
//! 
//! Hence, this crate allows those external components to register their own 
//! unwind information as needed.
//! Currently, we use this crate to support [`wasmtime-jit`], which needs to 
//! [register unwinding information] for JIT-compiled native code built from WASM binaries
//! and then deregister it when those JIT-ted modules are destroyed.
//!
//! The API here is loosely similar to `libunwind`'s two-part API: 
//! `__register_frame()` and `__deregister_frame()`.
//! Because it must accept raw pointers to sections, all APIs are inherently unsafe.
//! 
//! ## Future TODOs
//! Currently, this crate unsafely assumes that the third party component that registers its unwind info
//! will ensure that unwind info is valid for the full duration of it being registered.
//! 
//! In the future, ideally we would redesign this crate to offer a safer API
//! that obtains shared ownership
//! However, that would of course require modifying the dependent crates and redesigning them
//! to utilize this safer API.
//!
