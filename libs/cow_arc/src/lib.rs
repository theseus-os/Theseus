/// A special form of an `Arc` reference that uses two nested `Arc`s to support a 
/// mechanism similar to copy-on-write or clone-on-write.
/// 
/// Effectively, this type reduces to `Arc<Arc<Mutex<T>>>`.
/// 
/// Unlike regular `Arc`s, which do not permit mutability if there are multiple strong or weak references
/// to the data inside the `Arc`, the `CowArc` type can still allow interior mutability of the data `T`
/// when there are multiple strong or weak references to it. 
/// This works by treating the inner `Arc` reference as the actual reference count,
/// enabling it to differentiate between two states:     
/// * Exclusive:  only a single strong reference to the internal `Arc`, 
///   meaning that it is okay to mutate the data.
/// * Shared:  there are multiple strong references to the internal `Arc`,
///   meaning that it cannot be accessed mutably. 
/// 
/// The inner data `T` is protected by a `Mutex`, allowing it to be borrowed mutably 
/// when the `CowArc` is in the `Exclusive` state only. 
/// The inner data can be borrowed immutably in either state. 
/// 
/// This point of this data type is to encourage deeply copying data that's in the `Shared` state
/// in order to modify it, because deeply copying (cloning) `Shared` data will yield a new instance
/// that starts in the `Exclusive` state by default.
/// 
/// Finally, the `CowArc` type can be "cloned" in two ways:     
/// * using the regular `clone` function, which actually affects the shared state
///   by duplicating the inner reference, meaning that the `CowArc` will be in the shared state after invoking `clone`,
/// * using the [`clone_shallow`](#method.clone_shallow) function, which does not affect the shared state
///   and only duplicates the outer reference.
